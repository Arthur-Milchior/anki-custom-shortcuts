All the keywords are exactly the same as the keywords used in the json file, making the lines copy-pastable. (Those who want to remove the numbers from stuff like "reviewer flip card" can do so as well)

**Make sure to remap keys to empty keyspace.**

##Add-on Preferences

**These options are for changing a few settings on the add-on itself.**

"\u03a9 custom paste end style": For the exceptionally lazy (like me). If set to "y", inserts a `</span>` and a zero-width space at the end of the custom text to stop the custom style from bleeding into new text.

Otherwise, the custom paste will behave exactly like regular paste.

"\u03a9 custom paste text": Controls what html will be pasted by "custom paste" in "editor \_extras"	
e.g. `"\u03a9 custom paste text": "<span style=\"font-size: 20px; color:#3399ff\">â—†</span>"`

"\u03a9 enable conflict warning": If set to "y", shows a warning window whenever two shortcuts of the same type are set to the same key.
