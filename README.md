# Custom Shortcuts for Anki 2.1

An Anki addon that currently supports customization of editor shortcuts and homepage shortcuts.

Waiting to release on the addons page because right now the code is *spaghetti*

So far, the app has undergone slight amounts of testing, but if you encounter a bug or problem, feel free to bring up a new issue here. 

## Future Features

- Modify the toolbar to reflect custom shortcuts
- Include more shortcuts
